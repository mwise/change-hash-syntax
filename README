This plugin chnages Ruby hash syntax to 1.9

# before
hash = { :one => 1, :two => 2 }

# after
hash = { one: 1, two: 2 }


To change hash syntax, just call :ChangeHashSyntax. By default it operates on the entire file. Pass a range (or use V to select some lines) to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.
